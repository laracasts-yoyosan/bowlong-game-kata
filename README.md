# Rules

- 10 frames
    - 1 or 2 shots for each frame
    - score = the number of pins from the 1st and 2nd shots
    - Spare: is awarded when no pins are left standing after the second ball of a frame; i.e., a player uses both balls of a frame to clear all ten pins. A player achieving a spare is awarded ten points, plus a bonus of whatever is scored with the next ball (only the first ball is counted). It is typically rendered as a slash on score sheets in place of the second pin count for a frame.
        - 5
        - 5 // spare
        - 7 // (10 + 7) + 7
    - Strike: when all ten pins are completely knocked down with the first ball (called a strike and typically rendered as an "X" on a score sheet), a player is awarded ten points, plus a bonus of whatever is scored with the next two balls. In this way, the points scored for the two balls after the strike are counted twice.
